# Nesting Ifs

The problem is that an inner `IfGEImpl` appears as part of the
next outer `c.res`, and calling `c.res.expand` will fail.

It is possible that a solution is to not eagerly expand the results
and eagerly create the result link. Then instead of storing a `Link`
as the value in source map for an `IfGEImpl.ref`, we have to store
The cases. Note that the `_children` for that parent always are
in the same order of the cases, but reversed. Then, the calling
instance must in this list correspond to `head` (last prepended),
and the `else`-clause child is the second in this list, and the
first `if`-clause child is the last in this last (first prepended). 
So we can align up the children and the cases using
`cases zip _children.tail.reverse`. Or we can add a bit of overhead
and make it easier to understand, and store in the source-map value
not just the cases, but already pairs of `(c, child)`. 

Either way, fore each of these pairs we run

    val childChans = child.run {
      Out.ar(busCtl, c.res)
      c.res.expand.outputs.size
    }

And this way collect the number of channels. (Again we are not
wrapping here if there are branches with less channels, but this
could be added by iterating twice, first with expanding, then with
adding `Out.ar(busCtl, WrapExtendChannels(c.res, maxChans))`.

As before in `tryRefer`, we check first the `linkMap` for `IfGEImpl.ref`,
so the above expansion is guaranteed to happen only once.
