# Branching Synth Graph

- UGen graph builder collects all branches (including the main branch)
  as separate `UGenGraph` instances.
- The caller will run all `Synth` instances within a `Group`, thus 
  controls can simply retain their names if used across multiple 
  branches.

## Monitoring the (accumulated) branch condition

See `Resume.scala`. We set up two synths, the main branch using
`Pause` to start and stop the conditional branch. The conditional
branch reads a control (mapped to a bus and written by the main
branch) to receive information about it being resumed.
